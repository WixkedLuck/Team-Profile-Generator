# Team-Profile-Generator

Challenge 10 for UoM Node.js Team Website Generator:  

For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating a team website Generator using Node.js

- The motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with using Node.js and creating a generator that creates Readme.md files. 
 
- I built this project to advance my skills with working with node.js and learning how to use the inquirer, fs, and util packages.  

- This project resolves around having a user answer questions about their project to create a automatic Readme file. Once the user answers all questions a file is created and can be deployed/ read.    

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable with node.js and installing packages 

# Installation
