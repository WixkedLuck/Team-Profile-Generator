# Team-Profile-Generator

Challenge 10 for UoM Node.js Team Website Generator:  

For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating a team website Generator using Node.js and test the different classes with jest

- The motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with using Node.js and creating a website based off of users input with inquirer.  
 
- I built this project to advance my skills with working with node.js and learning how to use the inquirer, fs, and jest.  

- This project resolves around having a user answer questions about creating a team. The user after creating a manager can then add a developer or intern an infinite amount of times until they terminate the loop. After, a html page is created with this input. 

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable with node.js and working with classes.
